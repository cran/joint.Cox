Description: Fit survival data and perform dynamic prediction under joint frailty-copula models for tumour progression and death.
 Likelihood-based methods are employed for estimating model parameters, where the baseline hazard functions are modeled by the cubic M-spline or the Weibull model.
 The methods are applicable for meta-analytic data containing individual-patient information from several studies.
 Survival outcomes need information on both terminal event time (e.g., time-to-death) and non-terminal event time (e.g., time-to-tumour progression).
