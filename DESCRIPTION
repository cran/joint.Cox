Description: Perform the Cox regression and dynamic prediction under the joint frailty-copula model between tumour progression and death for meta-analysis.
 The method is applicable for meta-analytic data combining several studies. The data should have information on both terminal event time (e.g., time-to-death) and non-terminal event time (e.g., time-to-tumour progression).
