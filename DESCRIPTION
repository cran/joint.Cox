Description: Perform likelihood estimation and dynamic prediction under
 joint frailty-copula models for tumour progression and death in meta-analysis.
 A penalized likelihood method is employed for estimating model parameters, where the baseline hazard functions are modeled by smoothing splines.
 The methods are applicable for meta-analytic data combining several studies.
 The methods can analyze data having information on both terminal event time (e.g., time-to-death) and non-terminal event time (e.g., time-to-tumour progression).
 See Emura et al. (2017) <doi:10.1177/0962280215604510> for likelihood estimation, and
 Emura et al. (2018) <doi:10.1177/0962280216688032> for dynamic prediction.
 Survival data from ovarian cancer patients are also available.
